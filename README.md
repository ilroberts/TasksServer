# Dropwizard JDBI


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ilroberts/TasksServer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ilroberts/TasksServer)

Test project for Dropwizard 10 using JDBI to interact with a DB.

## Setup H2 DB

Creates an H2 DB populated with the migration scripts in src/main/resources/db/migration.

This main function of this application is to act as a back-end server for an Ember based todo application. It has now 
been updated to add a root element to the JSON to allow the Ember RESTSerializer to successfully serialize the retrieved
 JSON.

```
gradle flywayMigrate -i
```

## Run Dropwizard service

To compile:

```
gradle build
```

To run:

```
gradle run
```

Running the service will start an embedded H2 instance using the task.mv.db file generated by flyway.

To test:

```
gradle test
```
